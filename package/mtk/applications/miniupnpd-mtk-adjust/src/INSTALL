================================ *BSD/pf =================================
To Build and Install :

- first use ./configure
  For more details about options :
  > ./configure -h
  then edit config.h to fine tune to your preferences.
- use BSD make to compile.
- add "rdr-anchor miniupnpd" or/and "anchor miniupnpd" lines to /etc/pf.conf
  (Since OpenBSD 4.7, rdr-anchor lines are no longer used and should be
  removed, leaving only the anchor lines).
- some FreeBSD users reported that it is also necessary for them
  to explicitly allow udp traffic on 239.0.0.0/8 by adding the two following
  lines to /etc/pf.conf :
   pass out on $int_if from any to 239.0.0.0/8 keep state
   pass in on $int_if from any to 239.0.0.0/8 keep state
- don't forget to " pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf "
- you can check your modifications are taken into account with
  "pfctl -s nat" and "pfctl -s rule". Look for the "rdr-anchor miniupnpd"
  (if applicable) and/or "anchor miniupnpd" lines.
- OpenBSD users may need to add a multicast_host= line to /etc/rc.conf.local
  see $man 8 netstart
- install as root using :
  # make install
  or
  # PREFIX=/usr/local make install
- run as root : The daemon needs rights to modify pf rules.

=========================== *BSD,*Solaris/ipf =============================

configure tries to detect wether ipf or pf should be
used. If it fails, you can use ./configure --firewall=ipf
Installation steps are allmost the same as with pf.

*Solaris users would be interested in reading informations from :
http://blogs.sun.com/avalon/category/IPFilter

============================= Mac OS X/ipfw ===============================

- To enable non standard compilation options,
  > ./configure -h
- use either 'bsdmake -f Makefile.bsd' (if available) or 'make' to build

============================== Mac OS X/pf ================================

Starting with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, pf replaced ipfw as the OS X firewall.
also bsdmake is not available anymore.
Make sure you have installed the Xcode commande line tools (from the
Xcode Preferences menu or using 'xcode-select --install' command)

You need to download xnu sources : https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/xnu/
- If version of xnu >= 4570,
  > ./configure
  Then edit config.h, adding line "#define PFVAR_NEW_STYLE" to it.
> INCLUDES="-I.../xnu/bsd -I.../xnu/libkern" make

============================ Linux/netfilter ==============================
To Build and install :

- make sure you have libiptc available on your system :
  if you are using debian, "apt-get install iptables-dev"
  Some versions of the iptables-dev package don't include the
  necessary files : read "how to get libiptc with its headers on debian" below.
  In anycase, libiptc is available in iptables sources packages
  from http://netfilter.org
- edit and run netfilter/iptables_init.sh shell script.
  This script must allways be run before the daemon
  to set up initial rules and chains.
- Build and edit the config.h file
  > ./configure
  > vi config.h
- Build the daemon
  > make
  If not using iptables from your system,
  > ./configure --iptablespath=/path/to/iptables-1.4.1
  > make
- install as root using :
  > make install
- A miniupnpd script should be installed to /etc/init.d
  and the configuration files to /etc/miniupnpd
- anytime, you can use the netfilter/iptables_flush.sh
  script to flush all rules added by the daemon.
- after killing the daemon, you can get back to
  iptables initial state by running the netfilter/iptables_removeall.sh
  script. Don't forget to edit the script to your convenience.

NOTE: a /etc/init.d/miniupnpd script will be installed.
  If it suits you, you can use is with start, stop or restart argument.
  # /etc/init.d/miniupnpd restart


How to get libiptc with its headers on debian :
(Note: that should be useless now that netfilter/tiny_nf_nat.h is included)
- Use apt-get to get sources :
  > apt-get source iptables
  you should then have an iptables-x.x.x/ directory.
- configure and compile :
  > cd iptables-x.x.x/
  > ./configure --enable-static
  > make
- it is now possible to compile miniupnpd using the following command :
  > ./configure --iptablespath=/path/to/iptables-x.x.x
  > make

======================== Linux/netfilter nftables =========================

install the required development libraries. For debian :
 > apt-get install libnftnl-dev libmnl-dev

To build :
 > ./configure --firewall=nftables
 > make

=========================== Configuration =============================
The configuration file is either installed to /etc/miniupnpd.conf (BSD)
or /etc/miniupnpd/miniupnpd.conf (Linux)
Almost all options are also available through command line switches.

A basic configuration would set :
ext_ifname :   WAN network interface (interface connected to the internet)
listening_ip : LAN network interface (network where to supply NAT traversal)
enable_pcp_pmp=yes
enable_upnp=yes
and the permission rules (see below).

Historically, LAN had to be specified by IP/mask, such as
listening_ip=192.168.0.1/24
but if you compiled with IPv6 support, you need to specify an interface name :
listening_ip=eth0
The current code assumes there is only one IPv4 address assigned to LAN
interfaces. That is not the case with some CARP setup, there is then a risk
the wrong mask would be picked. You can force the mask when using interface
names :
listening_ip=eth0/24

Some users want to use miniupnpd on a NAT router which is connected to the
internet through another NAT router (NAT behind NAT). This kind of setup is
strongly discouraged. miniupnpd will refuses to launch when detecting a
private (RFC1918) "WAN" IP address. The ext_ip option sould be added :
ext_ifname=eth1  # "WAN" network interface, whose IP could be 192.168.1.22
ext_ip=80.1.2.3  # Real public IP address
listening_ip=eth0
Please note that miniupnpd doesn't redirect any port on the other NAT router.
UPNP requests forwarding is not implemented.
It is however possible to use STUN. See the ext_perform_stun / ext_stun_host
 / ext_stun_port options.

it is also possible to set a different interface for IPv6 WAN
ext_ifname=eth0
ext_ifname6=sit0

miniupnpd supports some kind of security check for allowing or disallowing
redirection to be made. The UPnP permission rules are read from the
miniupnpd.conf configuration file.
When a new redirection is requested, permission rules are evaluated in
top-down order and the first permission rule matched gives the response :
redirection allowed or denied. If no rule is matching, the redirection is
allowed, so it is a good practice to have a "catch all" deny permission
rule at the end of your permission ruleset.
Sample permission ruleset :
allow 4662-4672 192.168.1.34/32 4662-4672
deny 0-65535 192.168.1.34/32 0-65535
allow 1024-65535 192.168.1.0/24 1024-65535
deny 0-65535 0.0.0.0/0 0-65535
With this ruleset, redirections are allowed only for host on the subnet
192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 for the ports 1024 or above. There is an exception
for the host 192.168.1.34 for which only redirections from/to port 4662 to
4672 are allowed.

You can generate the uuid for your UPnP device with the uuidgen available
under linux. The following following OpenBSD package is also providing
a "uuid" tool :
http://www.openbsd.org/4.0_packages/i386/uuid-1.5.0.tgz-long.html
An web based uuid generator is also available :
http://kruithof.xs4all.nl/uuid/uuidgen

On linux systems, one could also use the command
'cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid' to generate an uuid.

More simple, use the genuuid makefile target :
> make genuuid
This target is needed by the "install" target, so it is done automatically
during install.

To stop the daemon use :
  # kill `cat /var/run/miniupnpd.pid`
or if your linux system use /etc/init.d/
  # /etc/init.d/miniupnpd stop


* Signals :
miniupnpd handles the following signals :
SIGUSR1: Send public IP address change notification
SIGUSR2: Handle special actions in Tomato Firmware version
         Or rewrite the lease_file
SIGINT:  Close gracefully
SIGTERM: Close gracefully
SIGPIPE: Ignore

There is code to detect change in network interfaces bsd/ifacewatcher.c and
linux/ifacewatcher.c, but if that code doesn't work for you, you may want to
send SIGUSR1 to miniupnpd if your public IP address changed.
