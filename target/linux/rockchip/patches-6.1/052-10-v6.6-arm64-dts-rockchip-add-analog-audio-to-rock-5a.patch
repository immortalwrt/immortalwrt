Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: add analog audio to rock-5a

Add analog audio support based on the Everest Semi ES8316 codec.

Note, that this currently does not support headphone plug events. The
Rock 5A uses a different headphone jack with a different logic to detect
a headphone plug. Unfortunately the detect GPIO is always low.
Downstream uses an ADC channel instead, but that is currently not
supported upstream.
