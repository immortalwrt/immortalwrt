Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix usb-c port functionality on
 rk3588-nanopc-t6

The USB-C port on the NanoPC-T6 was not providing VBUS (vbus5v0_typec
regulator disabled, gpio-58 out lo) due to misconfiguration. The
original setup with regulator-always-on and regulator-boot-on forced
the port on, masking the issue, but removing these properties revealed
that the fusb302 driver was not enabling the regulator dynamically.

Changes:
- Removed regulator-always-on and regulator-boot-on from vbus5v0_typec
  and vbus5v0_usb to allow driver control.
- Changed power-role from "source" to "dual" in the usb-c-connector to
  support OTG functionality.
- Added pd-revision = /bits/ 8 <0x2 0x0 0x1 0x2> to the FUSB302MPX
  node to specify USB Power Delivery (PD) Revision 2.0, Version 1.2,
  ensuring the driver correctly advertises PD capabilities and
  negotiates power roles (source/sink).
- Added op-sink-microwatt and sink-pdos for proper sink mode
  configuration (1W min, 15W max).
- Added typec-power-opmode = "1.5A" to enable 1.5A fallback for non-PD
  USB-C devices, aligning with the 5V/2A hardware limit.
- Set try-power-role to "source" to prioritize VBUS enablement.
- Adjusted usb_host0_xhci dr_mode from "host" to "otg" and added
  usb-role-switch for dual-role support.

Testing:
- Verified VBUS (5V) delivery to a sink device (USB thumb drive).
- Confirmed USB host mode with lsusb detecting connected devices.
- Validated USB device mode with adb devices when connected to a PC.
- Tested dual-role (OTG) functionality with try-power-role set to
  "source" and "sink"; "source" prioritizes faster VBUS activation.
- Validated functionality with a mobile device, including USB Power
  Delivery, file transfer, USB tethering, MIDI, and image transfer.
- Tested USB-C Ethernet adapter compatibility in host mode.
- Tested USB-C hub compatibility in host mode.
