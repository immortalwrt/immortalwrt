Subject: [PATCH] drm/gpuvm: rename struct drm_gpuva_manager to struct
 drm_gpuvm
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Rename struct drm_gpuva_manager to struct drm_gpuvm including
corresponding functions. This way the GPUVA manager's structures align
very well with the documentation of VM_BIND [1] and VM_BIND locking [2].

It also provides a better foundation for the naming of data structures
and functions introduced for implementing a common dma-resv per GPU-VM
including tracking of external and evicted objects in subsequent
patches.

-/**
- * DOC: Overview
- *
- * The DRM GPU VA Manager, represented by struct drm_gpuva_manager keeps track
- * of a GPU's virtual address (VA) space and manages the corresponding virtual
- * mappings represented by &drm_gpuva objects. It also keeps track of the
- * mapping's backing &drm_gem_object buffers.
- *
- * &drm_gem_object buffers maintain a list of &drm_gpuva objects representing
- * all existent GPU VA mappings using this &drm_gem_object as backing buffer.
- *
- * GPU VAs can be flagged as sparse, such that drivers may use GPU VAs to also
- * keep track of sparse PTEs in order to support Vulkan 'Sparse Resources'.
- *
- * The GPU VA manager internally uses a rb-tree to manage the
- * &drm_gpuva mappings within a GPU's virtual address space.
- *
- * The &drm_gpuva_manager contains a special &drm_gpuva representing the
- * portion of VA space reserved by the kernel. This node is initialized together
- * with the GPU VA manager instance and removed when the GPU VA manager is
- * destroyed.
- *
- * In a typical application drivers would embed struct drm_gpuva_manager and
- * struct drm_gpuva within their own driver specific structures, there won't be
- * any memory allocations of its own nor memory allocations of &drm_gpuva
- * entries.
- *
- * The data structures needed to store &drm_gpuvas within the &drm_gpuva_manager
- * are contained within struct drm_gpuva already. Hence, for inserting
- * &drm_gpuva entries from within dma-fence signalling critical sections it is
- * enough to pre-allocate the &drm_gpuva structures.

-/**
- * DOC: Split and Merge
- *
- * Besides its capability to manage and represent a GPU VA space, the
- * &drm_gpuva_manager also provides functions to let the &drm_gpuva_manager
- * calculate a sequence of operations to satisfy a given map or unmap request.
- *
- * Therefore the DRM GPU VA manager provides an algorithm implementing splitting
- * and merging of existent GPU VA mappings with the ones that are requested to
- * be mapped or unmapped. This feature is required by the Vulkan API to
- * implement Vulkan 'Sparse Memory Bindings' - drivers UAPIs often refer to this
- * as VM BIND.
- *
- * Drivers can call drm_gpuva_sm_map() to receive a sequence of callbacks
- * containing map, unmap and remap operations for a given newly requested
- * mapping. The sequence of callbacks represents the set of operations to
- * execute in order to integrate the new mapping cleanly into the current state
- * of the GPU VA space.
- *
- * Depending on how the new GPU VA mapping intersects with the existent mappings
- * of the GPU VA space the &drm_gpuva_fn_ops callbacks contain an arbitrary
- * amount of unmap operations, a maximum of two remap operations and a single
- * map operation. The caller might receive no callback at all if no operation is
- * required, e.g. if the requested mapping already exists in the exact same way.
- *
- * The single map operation represents the original map operation requested by
- * the caller.
- *
- * &drm_gpuva_op_unmap contains a 'keep' field, which indicates whether the
- * &drm_gpuva to unmap is physically contiguous with the original mapping
- * request. Optionally, if 'keep' is set, drivers may keep the actual page table
- * entries for this &drm_gpuva, adding the missing page table entries only and
- * update the &drm_gpuva_manager's view of things accordingly.
- *
- * Drivers may do the same optimization, namely delta page table updates, also
- * for remap operations. This is possible since &drm_gpuva_op_remap consists of
- * one unmap operation and one or two map operations, such that drivers can
- * derive the page table update delta accordingly.
- *
- * Note that there can't be more than two existent mappings to split up, one at
- * the beginning and one at the end of the new mapping, hence there is a
- * maximum of two remap operations.
- *
- * Analogous to drm_gpuva_sm_map() drm_gpuva_sm_unmap() uses &drm_gpuva_fn_ops
- * to call back into the driver in order to unmap a range of GPU VA space. The
- * logic behind this function is way simpler though: For all existent mappings
- * enclosed by the given range unmap operations are created. For mappings which
- * are only partically located within the given range, remap operations are
- * created such that those mappings are split up and re-mapped partically.
- *
- * As an alternative to drm_gpuva_sm_map() and drm_gpuva_sm_unmap(),
- * drm_gpuva_sm_map_ops_create() and drm_gpuva_sm_unmap_ops_create() can be used
- * to directly obtain an instance of struct drm_gpuva_ops containing a list of
- * &drm_gpuva_op, which can be iterated with drm_gpuva_for_each_op(). This list
- * contains the &drm_gpuva_ops analogous to the callbacks one would receive when
- * calling drm_gpuva_sm_map() or drm_gpuva_sm_unmap(). While this way requires
- * more memory (to allocate the &drm_gpuva_ops), it provides drivers a way to
- * iterate the &drm_gpuva_op multiple times, e.g. once in a context where memory
- * allocations are possible (e.g. to allocate GPU page tables) and once in the
- * dma-fence signalling critical path.
- *
- * To update the &drm_gpuva_manager's view of the GPU VA space
- * drm_gpuva_insert() and drm_gpuva_remove() may be used. These functions can
- * safely be used from &drm_gpuva_fn_ops callbacks originating from
- * drm_gpuva_sm_map() or drm_gpuva_sm_unmap(). However, it might be more
- * convenient to use the provided helper functions drm_gpuva_map(),
- * drm_gpuva_remap() and drm_gpuva_unmap() instead.
- *
- * The following diagram depicts the basic relationships of existent GPU VA
- * mappings, a newly requested mapping and the resulting mappings as implemented
- * by drm_gpuva_sm_map() - it doesn't cover any arbitrary combinations of these.
- *
- * 1) Requested mapping is identical. Replace it, but indicate the backing PTEs
- *    could be kept.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0     a     1
- *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0     a     1
- *	req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0     a     1
- *	new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *
- * 2) Requested mapping is identical, except for the BO offset, hence replace
- *    the mapping.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0     a     1
- *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0     a     1
- *	req: |-----------| (bo_offset=m)
- *
- *	     0     a     1
- *	new: |-----------| (bo_offset=m)
- *
- *
- * 3) Requested mapping is identical, except for the backing BO, hence replace
- *    the mapping.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0     a     1
- *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0     b     1
- *	req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0     b     1
- *	new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *
- * 4) Existent mapping is a left aligned subset of the requested one, hence
- *    replace the existent one.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0  a  1
- *	old: |-----|       (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0     a     2
- *	req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0     a     2
- *	new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *    .. note::
- *       We expect to see the same result for a request with a different BO
- *       and/or non-contiguous BO offset.
- *
- *
- * 5) Requested mapping's range is a left aligned subset of the existent one,
- *    but backed by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
- *    the existent one adjusting its BO offset.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0     a     2
- *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0  b  1
- *	req: |-----|       (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0  b  1  a' 2
- *	new: |-----|-----| (b.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1)
- *
- *    .. note::
- *       We expect to see the same result for a request with a different BO
- *       and/or non-contiguous BO offset.
- *
- *
- * 6) Existent mapping is a superset of the requested mapping. Split it up, but
- *    indicate that the backing PTEs could be kept.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0     a     2
- *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0  a  1
- *	req: |-----|       (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	     0  a  1  a' 2
- *	new: |-----|-----| (a.bo_offset=n, a'.bo_offset=n+1)
- *
- *
- * 7) Requested mapping's range is a right aligned subset of the existent one,
- *    but backed by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
- *    the existent one, without adjusting the BO offset.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0     a     2
- *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	           1  b  2
- *	req:       |-----| (bo_offset=m)
- *
- *	     0  a  1  b  2
- *	new: |-----|-----| (a.bo_offset=n,b.bo_offset=m)
- *
- *
- * 8) Existent mapping is a superset of the requested mapping. Split it up, but
- *    indicate that the backing PTEs could be kept.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	      0     a     2
- *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	           1  a  2
- *	req:       |-----| (bo_offset=n+1)
- *
- *	     0  a' 1  a  2
- *	new: |-----|-----| (a'.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1)
- *
- *
- * 9) Existent mapping is overlapped at the end by the requested mapping backed
- *    by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split up the
- *    existent one, without adjusting the BO offset.
- *
- *    ::
- *
- *	     0     a     2
- *	old: |-----------|       (bo_offset=n)
- *
- *	           1     b     3
- *	req:       |-----------| (bo_offset=m)
- *
- *	     0  a  1     b     3
- *	new: |-----|-----------| (a.bo_offset=n,b.bo_offset=m)
- *
- *
- * 10) Existent mapping is overlapped by the requested mapping, both having the
- *     same backing BO with a contiguous offset. Indicate the backing PTEs of
- *     the old mapping could be kept.
- *
- *     ::
- *
- *	      0     a     2
- *	 old: |-----------|       (bo_offset=n)
- *

- *	 new: |-----|-----------| (a'.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1)
- *
- *
- * 11) Requested mapping's range is a centered subset of the existent one
- *     having a different backing BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
- *     up the existent one in two mappings, adjusting the BO offset of the right
- *     one accordingly.

-/**
- * DOC: Locking
- *
- * Generally, the GPU VA manager does not take care of locking itself, it is
- * the drivers responsibility to take care about locking. Drivers might want to
- * protect the following operations: inserting, removing and iterating
- * &drm_gpuva objects as well as generating all kinds of operations, such as
- * split / merge or prefetch.
- *
- * The GPU VA manager also does not take care of the locking of the backing
- * &drm_gem_object buffers GPU VA lists by itself; drivers are responsible to
- * enforce mutual exclusion using either the GEMs dma_resv lock or alternatively
- * a driver specific external lock. For the latter see also
- * drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock().
- *
- * However, the GPU VA manager contains lockdep checks to ensure callers of its
- * API hold the corresponding lock whenever the &drm_gem_objects GPU VA list is
- * accessed by functions such as drm_gpuva_link() or drm_gpuva_unlink().
- */
-
-/**
- * DOC: Examples
- *
- * This section gives two examples on how to let the DRM GPUVA Manager generate
- * &drm_gpuva_op in order to satisfy a given map or unmap request and how to
- * make use of them.
- *
- * The below code is strictly limited to illustrate the generic usage pattern.
- * To maintain simplicitly, it doesn't make use of any abstractions for common
- * code, different (asyncronous) stages with fence signalling critical paths,
- * any other helpers or error handling in terms of freeing memory and dropping
- * previously taken locks.
- *
- * 1) Obtain a list of &drm_gpuva_op to create a new mapping::
- *
- *	// Allocates a new &drm_gpuva.
- *	struct drm_gpuva * driver_gpuva_alloc(void);
- *
- *	// Typically drivers would embedd the &drm_gpuva_manager and &drm_gpuva
- *	// structure in individual driver structures and lock the dma-resv with
- *	// drm_exec or similar helpers.
- *	int driver_mapping_create(struct drm_gpuva_manager *mgr,
- *				  u64 addr, u64 range,
- *				  struct drm_gem_object *obj, u64 offset)
- *	{
- *		struct drm_gpuva_ops *ops;
- *		struct drm_gpuva_op *op
- *
- *		driver_lock_va_space();
- *		ops = drm_gpuva_sm_map_ops_create(mgr, addr, range,
- *						  obj, offset);
- *		if (IS_ERR(ops))
- *			return PTR_ERR(ops);
- *
- *		drm_gpuva_for_each_op(op, ops) {
- *			struct drm_gpuva *va;
- *
- *			switch (op->op) {
- *			case DRM_GPUVA_OP_MAP:
- *				va = driver_gpuva_alloc();

+/**
+ * DOC: Overview
+ *
+ * The DRM GPU VA Manager, represented by struct drm_gpuvm keeps track of a
+ * GPU's virtual address (VA) space and manages the corresponding virtual
+ * mappings represented by &drm_gpuva objects. It also keeps track of the
+ * mapping's backing &drm_gem_object buffers.
+ *
+ * &drm_gem_object buffers maintain a list of &drm_gpuva objects representing
+ * all existent GPU VA mappings using this &drm_gem_object as backing buffer.
+ *
+ * GPU VAs can be flagged as sparse, such that drivers may use GPU VAs to also
+ * keep track of sparse PTEs in order to support Vulkan 'Sparse Resources'.
+ *
+ * The GPU VA manager internally uses a rb-tree to manage the
+ * &drm_gpuva mappings within a GPU's virtual address space.
+ *
+ * The &drm_gpuvm structure contains a special &drm_gpuva representing the
+ * portion of VA space reserved by the kernel. This node is initialized together
+ * with the GPU VA manager instance and removed when the GPU VA manager is
+ * destroyed.
+ *
+ * In a typical application drivers would embed struct drm_gpuvm and
+ * struct drm_gpuva within their own driver specific structures, there won't be
+ * any memory allocations of its own nor memory allocations of &drm_gpuva
+ * entries.
+ *
+ * The data structures needed to store &drm_gpuvas within the &drm_gpuvm are
+ * contained within struct drm_gpuva already. Hence, for inserting &drm_gpuva
+ * entries from within dma-fence signalling critical sections it is enough to
+ * pre-allocate the &drm_gpuva structures.
+ */
+
+/**
+ * DOC: Split and Merge
+ *
+ * Besides its capability to manage and represent a GPU VA space, the
+ * GPU VA manager also provides functions to let the &drm_gpuvm calculate a
+ * sequence of operations to satisfy a given map or unmap request.
+ *
+ * Therefore the DRM GPU VA manager provides an algorithm implementing splitting
+ * and merging of existent GPU VA mappings with the ones that are requested to
+ * be mapped or unmapped. This feature is required by the Vulkan API to
+ * implement Vulkan 'Sparse Memory Bindings' - drivers UAPIs often refer to this
+ * as VM BIND.
+ *
+ * Drivers can call drm_gpuvm_sm_map() to receive a sequence of callbacks
+ * containing map, unmap and remap operations for a given newly requested
+ * mapping. The sequence of callbacks represents the set of operations to
+ * execute in order to integrate the new mapping cleanly into the current state
+ * of the GPU VA space.
+ *
+ * Depending on how the new GPU VA mapping intersects with the existent mappings
+ * of the GPU VA space the &drm_gpuvm_ops callbacks contain an arbitrary amount
+ * of unmap operations, a maximum of two remap operations and a single map
+ * operation. The caller might receive no callback at all if no operation is
+ * required, e.g. if the requested mapping already exists in the exact same way.
+ *
+ * The single map operation represents the original map operation requested by
+ * the caller.
+ *
+ * &drm_gpuva_op_unmap contains a 'keep' field, which indicates whether the
+ * &drm_gpuva to unmap is physically contiguous with the original mapping
+ * request. Optionally, if 'keep' is set, drivers may keep the actual page table
+ * entries for this &drm_gpuva, adding the missing page table entries only and
+ * update the &drm_gpuvm's view of things accordingly.
+ *
+ * Drivers may do the same optimization, namely delta page table updates, also
+ * for remap operations. This is possible since &drm_gpuva_op_remap consists of
+ * one unmap operation and one or two map operations, such that drivers can
+ * derive the page table update delta accordingly.
+ *
+ * Note that there can't be more than two existent mappings to split up, one at
+ * the beginning and one at the end of the new mapping, hence there is a
+ * maximum of two remap operations.
+ *
+ * Analogous to drm_gpuvm_sm_map() drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap() uses &drm_gpuvm_ops to
+ * call back into the driver in order to unmap a range of GPU VA space. The
+ * logic behind this function is way simpler though: For all existent mappings
+ * enclosed by the given range unmap operations are created. For mappings which
+ * are only partically located within the given range, remap operations are
+ * created such that those mappings are split up and re-mapped partically.
+ *
+ * As an alternative to drm_gpuvm_sm_map() and drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap(),
+ * drm_gpuvm_sm_map_ops_create() and drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap_ops_create() can be used
+ * to directly obtain an instance of struct drm_gpuva_ops containing a list of
+ * &drm_gpuva_op, which can be iterated with drm_gpuva_for_each_op(). This list
+ * contains the &drm_gpuva_ops analogous to the callbacks one would receive when
+ * calling drm_gpuvm_sm_map() or drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap(). While this way requires
+ * more memory (to allocate the &drm_gpuva_ops), it provides drivers a way to
+ * iterate the &drm_gpuva_op multiple times, e.g. once in a context where memory
+ * allocations are possible (e.g. to allocate GPU page tables) and once in the
+ * dma-fence signalling critical path.
+ *
+ * To update the &drm_gpuvm's view of the GPU VA space drm_gpuva_insert() and
+ * drm_gpuva_remove() may be used. These functions can safely be used from
+ * &drm_gpuvm_ops callbacks originating from drm_gpuvm_sm_map() or
+ * drm_gpuvm_sm_unmap(). However, it might be more convenient to use the
+ * provided helper functions drm_gpuva_map(), drm_gpuva_remap() and
+ * drm_gpuva_unmap() instead.
+ *
+ * The following diagram depicts the basic relationships of existent GPU VA
+ * mappings, a newly requested mapping and the resulting mappings as implemented
+ * by drm_gpuvm_sm_map() - it doesn't cover any arbitrary combinations of these.
+ *
+ * 1) Requested mapping is identical. Replace it, but indicate the backing PTEs
+ *    could be kept.
+ *
+ *    ::
+ *

+ *	req: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
+ *
+ *	     0     a     1
+ *	new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
+ *
+ *
+ * 2) Requested mapping is identical, except for the BO offset, hence replace
+ *    the mapping.
+ *
+ *    ::
+ *
+ *	     0     a     1
+ *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

+ *
+ *	     0     a     1
+ *	new: |-----------| (bo_offset=m)
+ *
+ *
+ * 3) Requested mapping is identical, except for the backing BO, hence replace
+ *    the mapping.
+ *
+ *    ::
+ *
+ *	     0     a     1
+ *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

+ *	new: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)
+ *
+ *
+ * 4) Existent mapping is a left aligned subset of the requested one, hence
+ *    replace the existent one.

+ *
+ *    .. note::
+ *       We expect to see the same result for a request with a different BO
+ *       and/or non-contiguous BO offset.
+ *
+ *
+ * 5) Requested mapping's range is a left aligned subset of the existent one,
+ *    but backed by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
+ *    the existent one adjusting its BO offset.
+ *
+ *    ::
+ *
+ *	     0     a     2
+ *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

+ *       and/or non-contiguous BO offset.
+ *
+ *
+ * 6) Existent mapping is a superset of the requested mapping. Split it up, but
+ *    indicate that the backing PTEs could be kept.
+ *
+ *    ::
+ *

+ *
+ *	     0  a  1  a' 2
+ *	new: |-----|-----| (a.bo_offset=n, a'.bo_offset=n+1)
+ *
+ *
+ * 7) Requested mapping's range is a right aligned subset of the existent one,
+ *    but backed by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split
+ *    the existent one, without adjusting the BO offset.
+ *
+ *    ::
+ *
+ *	     0     a     2
+ *	old: |-----------| (bo_offset=n)

+ *
+ *	     0  a  1  b  2
+ *	new: |-----|-----| (a.bo_offset=n,b.bo_offset=m)

+ *
+ *	     0  a' 1  a  2
+ *	new: |-----|-----| (a'.bo_offset=n, a.bo_offset=n+1)
+ *
+ *
+ * 9) Existent mapping is overlapped at the end by the requested mapping backed
+ *    by a different BO. Hence, map the requested mapping and split up the
+ *    existent one, without adjusting the BO offset.
+ *
+ *    ::
+ *
+ *	     0     a     2

+ *
+ *	     0  a  1     b     3
+ *	new: |-----|-----------| (a.bo_offset=n,b.bo_offset=m)
+ *
+ *
+ * 10) Existent mapping is overlapped by the requested mapping, both having the
+ *     same backing BO with a contiguous offset. Indicate the backing PTEs of
+ *     the old mapping could be kept.
+ *
+ *     ::

+ *
+ *
+ * 11) Requested mapping's range is a centered subset of the existent one

+/**
+ * DOC: Locking
+ *
+ * Generally, the GPU VA manager does not take care of locking itself, it is
+ * the drivers responsibility to take care about locking. Drivers might want to
+ * protect the following operations: inserting, removing and iterating
+ * &drm_gpuva objects as well as generating all kinds of operations, such as
+ * split / merge or prefetch.
+ *
+ * The GPU VA manager also does not take care of the locking of the backing
+ * &drm_gem_object buffers GPU VA lists by itself; drivers are responsible to
+ * enforce mutual exclusion using either the GEMs dma_resv lock or alternatively
+ * a driver specific external lock. For the latter see also
+ * drm_gem_gpuva_set_lock().
+ *
+ * However, the GPU VA manager contains lockdep checks to ensure callers of its
+ * API hold the corresponding lock whenever the &drm_gem_objects GPU VA list is
+ * accessed by functions such as drm_gpuva_link() or drm_gpuva_unlink().
+ */
+
+/**
+ * DOC: Examples
+ *
+ * This section gives two examples on how to let the DRM GPUVA Manager generate
+ * &drm_gpuva_op in order to satisfy a given map or unmap request and how to
+ * make use of them.
+ *
+ * The below code is strictly limited to illustrate the generic usage pattern.
+ * To maintain simplicitly, it doesn't make use of any abstractions for common
+ * code, different (asyncronous) stages with fence signalling critical paths,
+ * any other helpers or error handling in terms of freeing memory and dropping
+ * previously taken locks.
+ *
+ * 1) Obtain a list of &drm_gpuva_op to create a new mapping::
+ *
+ *	// Allocates a new &drm_gpuva.
+ *	struct drm_gpuva * driver_gpuva_alloc(void);
+ *
+ *	// Typically drivers would embedd the &drm_gpuvm and &drm_gpuva
+ *	// structure in individual driver structures and lock the dma-resv with
+ *	// drm_exec or similar helpers.
+ *	int driver_mapping_create(struct drm_gpuvm *gpuvm,
+ *				  u64 addr, u64 range,
+ *				  struct drm_gem_object *obj, u64 offset)
+ *	{
