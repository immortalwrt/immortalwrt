Subject: [PATCH] drm/panthor: Relax the constraints on the tiler chunk size

The field used to store the chunk size if 12 bits wide, and the encoding
is chunk_size = chunk_header.chunk_size << 12, which gives us a
theoretical [4k:8M] range. This range is further limited by
implementation constraints, and all known implementations seem to
impose a [128k:8M] range, so do the same here.

We also relax the power-of-two constraint, which doesn't seem to
exist on v10. This will allow userspace to fine-tune initial/max
tiler memory on memory-constrained devices.

v4:
- Actually fix the range in the kerneldoc

v3:
- Add R-bs
- Fix valid range in the kerneldoc

v2:
- Turn the power-of-two constraint into a page-aligned constraint to allow
  fine-tune of the initial/max heap memory size
- Fix the panthor_heap_create() kerneldoc

Fixes: 9cca48fa4f89 ("drm/panthor: Add the heap logical block")
