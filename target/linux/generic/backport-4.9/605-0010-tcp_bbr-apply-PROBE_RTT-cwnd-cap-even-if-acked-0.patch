Subject: [PATCH] BACKPORT: tcp_bbr: apply PROBE_RTT cwnd cap even if acked==0

This commit fixes a corner case where TCP BBR would enter PROBE_RTT
mode but not reduce its cwnd. If a TCP receiver ACKed less than one
full segment, the number of delivered/acked packets was 0, so that
bbr_set_cwnd() would short-circuit and exit early, without cutting
cwnd to the value we want for PROBE_RTT.

The fix is to instead make sure that even when 0 full packets are
ACKed, we do apply all the appropriate caps, including the cap that
applies in PROBE_RTT mode.
