Subject: [PATCH] dist: support run in curdir

As https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#vue-config-js said:
```
By default, Vue CLI assumes your app will be deployed at the root of
a domain, e.g. https://www.my-app.com/. If your app is deployed at a
sub-path, you will need to specify that sub-path using this option.
For example, if your app is deployed at https://www.foobar.com/my-app/,
set publicPath to '/my-app/'.

The value can also be set to an empty string ('') or a relative path (./)
so that all assets are linked using relative paths. This allows the built
bundle to be deployed under any public path, or used in a file system based
environment like a Cordova hybrid app.
```
